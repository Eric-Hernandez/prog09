0. Create package prog09.

1. Finish implementing InsertionSort and test.

2. Ditto HeapSort.  (Uncomment line in main.)

3. Ditto QuickSort.

4. Ditto MergeSort.

5. For homework, measure the running time of each sorting algorithm on
   larger arrays of Integer.  If the user provides a size on the
   command line, then make the array that size and initialize it with
   random integers.  (random.nextInt() gives a random integer).

   Don't print out the array if it is bigger than a 100 in size.

   Print out the running time of each method for different sizes.  Use
   the techniques you learned in prog03 to calculate an accurate
   running time.

   You should not make a clone (copy) of the array each time you call
   the sorting method to time it.  Instead, make only one clone and
   then use System.arraycopy to copy the original array into the copy
   array each time.  You have to copy the original array into the
   copy, otherwise you will be sorting an already-sorted array for the
   second call to sort and each subsequent call.
   
   Put the values you got on your computer as comments in your program
   for n=1000, 10000, up to 10000000.  You to put in an if-condition
   to prevent the call to test InsertionSort for most of the large
   values of n.
